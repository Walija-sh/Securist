            <h4>Limitations of existing systems</h4>
            <p>The proliferation of blockchain businesses that started with Bitcoin, as if it were their own lowly faith, just a few years ago, and the emergence of blockchains with a powerful and scalable mainnet called Ethereum. Like a bamboo shoot growing in a skull, the industry has become both an opportunity and a danger, a gift to our generation. The sudden emergence of a new asset that has never existed in the history of mankind has sparked non-stop debates among and , from debates about its intrinsic value to the truths and falsehoods of its business model, and has created new heroes and victims.
            <span class="limit-hidden">
              And whether countries wanted to or not, individuals around the world began to incorporate crypto into their economies and build portfolios, and the naturally occurring ecosystem of crypto arising from human wisdom and greed was unstoppable.
               <br>
Contrary to the intentions of Bitcoin, which started with decentralization as its core motif, centralized exchanges arose out of market needs for trading new assets, and investors, who were unable to distinguish between dark and light before laws, regulations, standards, and controls were in place, became victims of information asymmetry and unable to identify pia. Currently, minimal laws and safeguards are standing up to protect investors in the fledgling stages of the cryptocurrency industry with a shaky shield of protection. Among the minimal safeguards, information security management system (ISMS) certification is a mandatory requirement to operate as a virtual asset service provider (VASP) in South Korea (the Specified Financial Information Act came into full effect on September 25, 2021), and the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA), a certification body under the Ministry of Science and ICT, organizes and conducts certification audits. However, the criteria for categorizing VASPs is still unclear, and it is very difficult to report to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) as a VASP and operate normally after acquiring ISMS certification. This can lead to monopolization and hinder the healthy growth of the industry and its global competitiveness.
<br>
In particular, the acquisition of ISMS certification, which is an essential prerequisite for operating a virtual asset business at this time, is so important that almost all of the reporting requirements can be considered, and the level required by the certification standard is quite , approaching the level of conventional financial institutions. 
<br>
Unlike other industries, where the failure rate is less than 5%, more than half failed to achieve final certification due to significant administrative and technical security deficiencies and unclear regulatory standards
<br>
This is largely due to the fact that cryptocurrency businesses have been rushed into the market with what they believe to be innovative business models without adequate security

In the future, if the exchange value of SECURIST(SECU) TOKEN with the company points operated by the partner companies is established through the partnership, SECURIST(SECU) TOKEN users who spend on the platform of the partner company will be credited with SECURIST(SECU) TOKEN, SECURIST(SECU) tokens are used to purchase, , and maintain the license of ATHENA, the  security certification management solution of EASYSECURE, so SECURIST(SECU) tokens have a stable incineration source, while partner companies can effectively secure financial resources to maintain the information security management system at all times without additional fixed costs. <br>
This inevitable demand for information protection as an ongoing business imperative will continue to expand as the SECURIST (SECU) TOKEN takes root and bears fruit through the SECURIST platform, where multiple partners can amicably collaborate with each other and have unlimited partnership possibilities.
